Create a visually stunning, ultra-modern title-slide background for a premium AI course presentation.

LESSON CONTEXT:
Before generating the background, read the lesson's presentation YAML file to understand its full content, topics, and narrative arc. Use this understanding to inform the abstract visual concept — the background should resonate with the lesson's themes without being literal.

TEXT CONTENT (the only elements that change):
Title: "{LESSON_TITLE}"
Subtitle: "{LESSON_DESCRIPTION}"

GLOBALADICALLY MODERN STYLE LOCK (must stay identical across all slides):

Cutting-edge, contemporary, high-end tech aesthetic

Minimal but bold

Intelligent, confident, and slightly provocative

Abstract, non-literal representation of intelligence

Feels like a top-tier AI conference keynote, not a corporate deck

VISUAL LANGUAGE (locked):

Flowing abstract forms, fields, layers, or structured motion

Subtle sense of depth and dimensionality

Visual tension between order and emergence

No explicit charts, graphs, or data visualizations

COLOR & MATERIAL FEEL (locked):

Dark, modern base (deep navy / charcoal / near-black)

One restrained accent tone (cool cyan, electric blue, or soft violet)

Soft glow or light diffusion allowed

No flat corporate gradients

COMPOSITION (locked):

Asymmetrical, contemporary layout

Text area clearly reserved and calm

Visual mass positioned to create contrast and drama

Strong negative space

16:9 aspect ratio

TEXT RENDERING (very important):

Clean, modern sans-serif typography

Large, confident title

Subtitle smaller, restrained

Perfect readability, no effects, no distortion

CONTROLLED VARIATION ONLY:

The abstract visual concept subtly reflects the lesson theme

The overall structure, color logic, and visual energy must remain unchanged

STRICTLY AVOID:

Literal AI symbols (brains, robots, neurons)

Charts, graphs, dashboards

Corporate illustration style

Playful or decorative visuals

Stock-image aesthetics

The result should feel bold, modern, intelligent, and visually memorable — clearly part of one cohesive, high-end AI slide system.
